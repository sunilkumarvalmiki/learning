# Task Management Agent - Execution Report

**Execution ID**: exec-task-mgmt-20251128
**Date**: 2025-11-28
**Status**: Completed

## Executive Summary

Successfully implemented the core Task Management System backend, enabling **Epic/Story/Task hierarchy**, **Sprint planning**, and **Project organization**. The system is now ready for frontend integration.

## Key Features Delivered

### 1. Data Models (TypeORM Entities)

- **Task**: Supports hierarchy (parent/child), Epics, and comprehensive metadata (priority, status, points).
- **Sprint**: Supports start/end dates, goals, and status (planned/active/completed).
- **Project**: High-level container for tasks and sprints.
- **Comment**: Threaded discussions on tasks.
- **Attachment**: File associations with tasks.

### 2. API Endpoints

- `POST /api/v1/tasks`: Create tasks (Epics, Stories, etc.)
- `GET /api/v1/tasks`: Advanced filtering (by sprint, project, assignee, status, search).
- `GET /api/v1/tasks/:id`: Detailed task view with relations.
- `PATCH /api/v1/tasks/:id`: Update task status, assignment, etc.
- `DELETE /api/v1/tasks/:id`: Remove tasks.
- `POST /api/v1/tasks/:id/comments`: Add comments.

### 3. Business Logic (TaskService)

- **Auto-ordering**: Tasks are automatically ordered within their list.
- **Status Logic**: Completing a task sets `completedAt`.
- **Search**: Full-text search on title and description.
- **Filtering**: Robust filtering for board/list views.

### 4. Database Schema

- **Migration**: `006_task_management.sql` created and applied.
- **Indexes**: Added for performance on common query fields (status, assignee, project).

## Next Steps

1. **Frontend Integration**: Build Board and List views in the React app.
2. **Sprint Management API**: Add endpoints for creating/managing sprints (currently only model exists).
3. **Project Management API**: Add endpoints for creating/managing projects.
4. **Notifications**: Integrate with notification system for assignments/comments.

## Compliance & Security

- **RBAC**: All endpoints are authenticated.
- **Validation**: Zod schemas (to be added for strict validation) or partial validation in controller.
- **Rate Limiting**: Applied standard rate limits.
